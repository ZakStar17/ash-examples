# Instance creation

This example covers creating an instance and enabling validation layers. 

The module for the validation layers is only compiled when the `vl` feature is enabled.

You can run this example with:

`RUST_LOG=debug cargo run`

## Cargo features

This example implements the following cargo features:

- `vl`: Enable validation layers.
- `load`: Load the system Vulkan Library at runtime.
- `link`: Link the system Vulkan Library at compile time.

`vl` and `load` are enabled by default. To disable them, pass `--no-default-features` to cargo.
For example:

`cargo run --release --no-default-features --features link`
